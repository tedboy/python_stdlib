37 Mac OS X specific services
*****************************

This chapter describes modules that are only available on the Mac OS X platform.

See the chapters :ref:`mac-scripting` and :ref:`undoc-mac-modules` for more
modules, and the HOWTO :ref:`using-on-mac` for a general introduction to
Mac-specific Python programming.

.. note::

   Most of the OS X APIs that these modules use are deprecated or removed
   in recent versions of OS X.  Many are not available when Python is
   executing in 64-bit mode.  These modules have been removed in
   Python 3.  You should avoid using them in Python 2.
