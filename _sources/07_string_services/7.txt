07. String Services
*******************

The modules described in this chapter provide a wide range of string
manipulation operations.

In addition, Python's built-in string classes support the sequence type
methods described in the :ref:`typesseq` section, and also the
string-specific methods described in the :ref:`string-methods` section.
To output formatted strings use template strings or the ``%`` operator
described in the :ref:`string-formatting` section. Also, see the
:mod:`re` module for string functions based on regular expressions.
