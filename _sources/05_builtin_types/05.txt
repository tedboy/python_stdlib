*****************
05 Built-in Types
*****************

The following sections describe the standard types that are built into the
interpreter.

.. note::

   Historically (until release 2.2), Python's built-in types have differed from
   user-defined types because it was not possible to use the built-in types as the
   basis for object-oriented inheritance. This limitation no longer
   exists.

.. index:: pair: built-in; types

The principal built-in types are numerics, sequences, mappings, files, classes,
instances and exceptions.

.. index:: statement: print

Some operations are supported by several object types; in particular,
practically all objects can be compared, tested for truth value, and converted
to a string (with the :ref:`repr() <func-repr>` function or the slightly different
:func:`str` function).  The latter function is implicitly used when an object is
written by the :func:`print` function.
